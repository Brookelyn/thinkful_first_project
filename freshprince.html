		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail<br />
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green<br />
		'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd<br />
		by ruffians contemptible and mean.<br />
		Although the spat was trivial and brief,<br />
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;<br />
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.<br />
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,<br />
		I came upon a coachman most unique;<br />
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,<br />
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.<br />
		I survey all the land with princely mien<br />
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
